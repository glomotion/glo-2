<p>Following the completion of all scoped objectives for <a href="/static/2012/07/protrada-v2-re-skinning-work/" title="protrada (v2) re-skinning work">Protrada V2</a>, I began work (as part of a small project team of two) on production of native IOS and Android mobile applications.</p>
<p>Sadly, this project didn&#8217;t quite get the budgetary allocation I had hoped for, so a lot of the customized IOS and Android controls featured in my designs, were substituted with standard, UI controls in the production versions of the apps.</p>

<h4>project critique:</h4>
<p>When I first joined Winged Media, I was tasked with cleaning up, and applying a new visual skins UI layer to what had become a slightly inconsistent and erratic visual interface (pictured above). Not included in the scope of this project however, was any task that entailed changes to the overall underlying framework / controls, thus improvements in the UX of the product were a little hamstrung by technical constraints (<a href="http://www.zend.com/en/" target="_blank">PHP/Zend</a>, Fixed width to 960px, centered, large use of the <a href="http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxGrid/index.shtml" target="_blank">DHTMLX Grid</a> etc).</p>
<p>This project involved a very heavy reliance on modal windows for cross-sectional functionality, thus a large portion of my time was spent creating dozens of intricate modal
</p></div>
</div>
<div class="col mid-lft">
<div class="d-insde-col">
<h4>. . .</h4>
<p>layouts which needed to display a wide variety of functionality inside of the relatively small container (usually around 700px x 500px) of a modal window. An important consideration here, was to keep internal scrolling to a minimum &#8211; so most user task-flows etc had to be split up into several steps &#8211; resulting in wizard like task processes.</p>
<p>In the UI of this project (which we dubbed Protrada v2), I tried to use the limited available space as best I could, compressing up things such as navigation and branding, whilst still endeavoring to maintain a balance of healthy negative space &#8211; to try to prevent the UI from becoming overly complicated or &#8216;busy&#8217;.
</p></div>

<div class="d-insde-col">
<h4><a href="http://www.protrada.com" target="_blank">launch project »</a></h4>
<p>Lastly, in Protrada v2, I was tasked to try and include (using a &#8216;bolt-on&#8217; style approach) and integrated communications and help layer to the interface (which we ended up calling/branding <a href="http://drbl.in/cdjz">&#8216;Alfred&#8217;</a>). Sadly, this area (like the rest of the project) was a little limited by the technology driving the system, and also never quite got the dev time that it needed, thus the end result came off as a little half-baked and superfluous. This area was designed to be a real-time assistant to users as they performed tasks in the system, giving them various sorts of visual <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/tom_chatfield_7_ways_games_reward_the_brain.html">&#8216;objective completion rewards&#8217;</a> and alerts/notifications when things they have set in motion are in need of their attention.</p></div>

<h4>project critique</h4>
<p>Protrada version 3 started out with the brief: &#8220;to make v2 seem a little bit more &#8220;appy&#8221; (not my words :)- ) &#8211; and grew into a holistic re-evaluation of the whole system’s front and backend, technology included.</p>
<p>Although I did participate in the research and testing behind our choice of new technology, I won&#8217;t go into detail explaining the in&#8217;s and outs of our choice just yet &#8211; but as always, If you&#8217;re curious to know more, please feel free to <a title="contact" href="/static/contact/">contact me</a>.</p>
<h4>&#8216;make it fast&#8217;&#8230; very fast</h4>
<p>One of the major focuses for Protrada v3 is around speed. <a title="protrada (v2) re-skinning work" href="/static/2012/07/protrada-v2-re-skinning-work/">Protrada Version 2 (v2)</a> has copped alot of negative feedback of recent for it&#8217;s poor/flaky performance, and this is not a problem we wanted to bring across to v3. As such, a lot of thinking and care was put around calls to the server for information, what was returned after doing so, and how that data is handled once it&#8217;s returned. We&#8217;ve worked tirelessly to minimize the AJAX calls that were necessary to populate grid data views and sections, and to minimize the content that is sent down inside each of these calls. Essentially, the concept at the very heart of v3, is that once the frontend framework is downloaded, the only things that come down from the server via ajax are JSON data feeds, which are then interpreted by the frontend, and displayed appropriately. Coupled with the speed of Node.js, and comprehensive Javascript frontend templates / frame-working, this enabled us to significantly improve the operation speed and bandwidth requirements of v3 &#8211; in fact so much so, to compare it with v2’s performance would be difficult.</p>
<h4>use of intuitive ‘panels’</h4>
<p>Protrada v2 certainly relied very heavily on modal technology to deploy task flow functionality etc (I’d estimate around 70% of the systems functionality exists inside of modal windows). Now modals do have some advantages when it comes to this, for example they can make task functionality global, in that it can be called upon from anywhere in an application.</p>
<p>This characteristic however, can also be a double edged sword.</p>
<p>The reduced level of context in modal functionality (created by blacking out the screen behind from which the modal came) can sometimes make an application seem more complex and confusing than necessary. IMO modal windows also are not quite the elegant UI solution, because of the way that they utilize available space. To combat this in v2, we had to split up many of the more complex user task flows, into paginated wizard style modal arrays, which were slow (a lot of unnecessary markup/css was needed), clunky, and very time consuming for users to work with.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col mid-lft">
<div class="d-insde-col">
<h4>&#8230;</h4>
<p>This in mind, I started to work with what we now call ‘panels’, to replace a lot of the modal-based functionality and flows. Panels give forms more room for content and functionality which will help us minimize unnecessary clicks, and allow for more helpful instructions and hints.</p>
<p>Another advantage to our panel UI component, is that we were able to integrate some system wide memory/logic around them, which is now able to track a users movement / interactions across the system, and restore the state of the UI (panels, UI settings and much more) to exactly what they bounced out of the system from. This was also a major sore point for v2, as users commonly have to repeat tasks if they either lose connection to the internet, go inactive for too long, or suffer an application failure during mid-task operation.</p>
<h4>a new, better grid for data display</h4>
<p>If ~70% of Protrada v2‘s functionality is inside of a modal window, ~25% of the remaining functionality can be found inside of the grid data controls.</p>
<p>Protrada uses grids much like they are an online version of excel. They allow users to filter, search &amp; sort a tables of all different types of data. In the Exchange there are millions of domains that can be accessed with various data attached to them so it is important to allow users to filter this data inline, as well as through other features like advanced search etc. This means, that instead of performing a search, deciding to alter this search and start again after seeing zero results &#8211; a user can now refine, edit, or completely shift search criteria interactively through the grid controls.</p>
<p>My new, improved grid control prototype also comes with some handy UI behaviors built in, such as thead snapping on large data views and snapped horizontal scrolling. Thead snapping, essentially means with a single flick of the finger (on a touch device or a magic mouse) &#8211; our UI becomes a fullscreen interactive spread-sheet, allowing users to view much 2 or 3 times more data at any one time. We introduced horizontal-scroll snapping in an effort to combat the annoying necessity of tabular data displays, to scroll to the bottom of the table before access to the native horizontal scrollbars is granted.</p>
<h4>bulk editing functionality</h4>
<p>Something I’ve learnt throughout the development of v2, is that bulk operations for just about every domain-related procedure is an absolute must, if we’re to cater effectively to users with large portfolio&#8217;s of domains (our target audience!). In v3 we have paid particular attention to these processes to make them as user friendly and as fast as possible. By introducing csv imports for most bulk operations we can allow owners to quickly tell Protrada to perform functions on their behalf.</p>
<p>A lot of care has also gone into ensuring that bulk functionality inside of the data grid views is not lost at the  bottom of the table. Now, when a user &#8216;tick&#8217; selects more than one domain, the bulk functionality menu appends itself to the thead, inside of a table row &#8211; ensuring it&#8217;s visible at all times during scrolling.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col mid-rght">
<div class="d-insde-col">
<h4>mobile and responsive</h4>
<p>Another huge ambition in my production of the v3 prototype, was the desire to create an app that can evolve to perfectly use any device’s form-factor, regardless of size &#8211; rather than just simply being accessible on a couple of different, though specified devices. To achieve this I’ve deployed a large amount of @media responsive css, and a tiny amount of UA sniffing to help de-tune UI features and refit the layout/components to any given form-factor/size.</p>
<p>I also built these styles / functionality, so that they can be in-acted manually by the user, from a global system menu, at the top left of the screen. For example users on smaller, less powerful devices can now de-tune their UI to remove shadows, gradients and unnecessary UI embellishments, to enhance application performance and usability on low resolutions.</p>
<p>In order to ease the transition into near future high pixel density displays, whilst also enabling savings on performance and bandwidth, I&#8217;ve deployed almost every single graphic asset used by the app&#8217;s UI &#8211; as a single @font-face icon font. This has enabled us to save eon&#8217;s of time in pain-staking spriting / image asset production &#8211; while also making less http requests and requiring less bytes to be sent to the user.</p>
<h4>alerts and notifications</h4>
<p>After learning from our experience with the ‘Alfred’ help/comms layer in v2 (placement of objects position: fixed to the bottom is extremely problematic, for one..:p) &#8211; this functionality is completely reinvented in v3. Kept in a toggle’able sidebar, our notifications and alerts system now contains tabbed list views of notifications that appear as they happen, through use of socket.io and node.js. When closed/hidden, the users can still see if new alerts are coming in, through the notification total bubbles in the top right of the layout.<br />
Alerts and notifications will now be a lot more helpful and specific, as I have designed into each of them the ability to display a corresponding action, required of the user. Once dismissed from this list, all msgs and alerts are then archived, allowing the user to go back in time and double check items that they may have overlooked or dismissed.</p>

<h4>project critique:</h4>
<p>Although the two technologies use similar resolutions (at least when an iPad is orientation: landscape), good design for handheld devices requires some very different thinking, compared to conventional user experience for laptop/computer based design. Upon beginning the process to create iPad/tablet based layouts from the current conventional JCC intranet mock layouts, one key difference in layout methodology started to become apparent to me.</p>
<p>In conventional design, because a movement of a mouse can be controlled so accurately in selecting items on the page (down to almost pixel for pixel accuracy) web design often entailed fitting a lot of information on the first screen fold, ensuring that said content would be visible without the user having to go looking for it and scrolling down the page. I was always in 2 minds about just how familiar web users are with scrolling down the page, and often tried to influence my clients toward spacing things out more, increasing text size and creating more white space &#8211; aiming for some kind of middle road between two extremes. Having said this, quite often in commercial ux design, it was hard to convince some clients of the merits in such an approach and hence designs often end up being squished so that the bulk of them fit In the top screen fold of the design (at least for the most common resolution size to render the website).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col mid-lft">
<div class="d-insde-col">
<h4>. . .</h4>
<p>Tablet and other touch based devices seem to reverse this trend however &#8211; instead interfaces and ui elements need to be treated more carefully regarding whitespace and size. Buttons need to be bigger, and interface elements need more space around them, so that they can be touched without risk of accidentally touching another element and so on. Of course this approach inevitably sacrifices the amount of content that is immediately available to the eye upon page load (without scrolling) &#8211; but this is not the end of he world, and almost definitely the lesser of two evils. The reason I say this, is that, scrolling on a touch device is so much more natural (at least to me), than trying to point out, read and interact with ui elements that are smaller than my (somewhat wide) fingers.</p>
<p>Applying this methodology to the iPad version of the jcca homepage, I began laying out a similarly structured mock, this time with an emphasis on enlarging interface elements &#8211; consequently lengthening the page layout to be two or three fold, instead of one and a half. Inline with this, I removed the navigation from the header and instead created a bottom navbar more akin to iPad applications. As fixing the nav bar to the bottom of the screen using position:fixed, isn&#8217;t possible on mobile webkit browsers due to the way they handle overflow:scroll, a small amount of simple JavaScript (along with a plugin called iscroll) may be needed to achieve this. The removal of the navigation from the header enabled the welcome customization to be moved to the header area, and allowed me to remove the entire personalized row, freeing up some much needed available height.</p>

<p>For the orientation:landscape layout I decided to keep the three column layout, as 1024px is more than enough width to display three columns of information, and readability can start to decline the longer lines of text get in width. To keep things simple, the page layout clean, and unnecessary image downloads low, I did away with the drop shadows on either edge of each column.</p>
<p>For the orientation:portrait layout, instead of simply allowing the default ipad functionality to zoom out and show more of the page&#8217;s length, I decided to vary the layout slightly. Replacing the two wide columns and one thin column, I Stacked the two wide columns on top of one another, which allowed the text size for the whole page to stay the same, thus not compromising readability in either orientation mode. Reverting back to a two column format also enabled me to display two articles alongside each other at a time, whilst not sacrificing space or text size, and increasing readability (I found the two columns of text easier to read than one wide column).</p>
<p>Due to the massive reduction in available width, the portrait mode logo area is designed to revert back to a simple logo motif, separating out the logo type so it can be reduced down and redeployed to the top left column.</p>

<h4>project critique:</h4>
<p>As with many intranet development projects, the John curtain college intranet was designed to be functional, yet friendly to it&#8217;s intended target audience (all school staff and students) to encourage frequent use, contribution and active collaboration. It was also to strongly follow the designated style guide and aesthetic that was adopted for the public website, some years ago &#8211; the faint diagonal lines and color scheme are all derived from the existing jcc brand.</p>
<p>The target technology of this intranet is centered around Apple products &#8211; namely MacBooks, MacBook Pro&#8217;s and iPads (as this is what the school is choosing to provide for all staff and students). Because of this, I was able to take advantage of a lot of new technology (CSS3, HTML5) without the extra work required to avoid less-than-graceful degradation in Older browsers. Also, given that when viewed on a computer, this intranet would most often be viewed in wide-screen (as the apple laptop offerings all come with a wide-screen (1280px) format monitor) I opted to use a fluid 1140px grid system layout, which can shrink down to a min-with of 990 if necessary, to accommodate lower resolutions.</p>
<p>Using the current John curtain college website as a starting point, I then began to consider a homepage that would focus the student/staff members attention, introduce the most important of the intranet&#8217;s functionality as a high level summary (according to the client these were to be daily notices, a comprehensive event display system and a look-in to recent file activity, allowing the dashboard to act as a simple snapshot for all the work that each staff member / student is currently engaged in) and provide simple access doorways deeper into core site functionality.</p>

<h4>. . .</h4>
<p>Starting out in the design process, I decided from the beginning that (similar to the public site) the header should be bold, well spaced out, and ideally personalized by whoever is looking at it. This accompanied by appropriate amounts of meaningful content, would help in capturing the browser&#8217;s focus, which of-course is a common kpi in most application / website&#8217;s home pages. It was therefore my intention to make this area the focal point of the page layout. Where possible, I tried to stay true to usual ui conventions (logo top left/center, user functionality top right, search top left) as this is what people are used to when interacting with digital interface, seeing little reason to move away from the norm.</p>
<p>Also In keeping with the intention to keep the interface friendly, where possible, I have also tried to keep buttons and interface elements large and rounded &#8211; these characteristics I often find synonymous with friendly, informal layouts, such as Vimeo, to state one example.</p>
<p>Working n the header area if the layout, It did dawn on me that some users (perhaps even all frequent users) of this intranet will most likely choose (if given the choice) a smaller, more impact header area, to allow more space for the real content of the site/app/page. To make allowance for this, I thought I would use some simple jQuery to include some functionality that empowers users to further customize their dashboard, by toggling the display of the header and welcoming messages, and saving that state through use of cookies.</p>
<p>For example, When the arrow button is interacted with (which will most likely need to be coupled with some hover pop-up jQuery enhancement, to make its purpose clearer), the header could revert to something more akin to the proportions of the internal page design.</p>

<h4><a href="http://stage.glo.id.au/jcc-intra/homepage(desktop).html" target="_blank">launch project »</a></h4>
<p>Following from the header area, it was my intention to draw the eye downward to the next most important area, the dally notices board stream feed. I waned this area to stand out amongst the other content areas, as this was one of the more important functions of the intranet. giving it a solid Grey/blue head, seemed to give it the emphasis needed, to move the eye down the page from the header area, into the page&#8217;s main content area. I thought it advantageous to treat the first notice in this listing as special, to help highlight what might be considered the most important notice in the stream, the most recently posted item.</p>
<p>Continuing with the layout, I intended to configure the hierarchy and coloring of the headings to further maneuver the eye across the to the other areas of functionality in this layout, the school events and recently used files section. To avoid clashing too much with the flow of the eye, I kept the listing data relatively low-key and neutrally colored, as I have often found that using harsh black on white can sometimes create visual noise in page, which can in turn confuse the intended movement path of the visitor&#8217;s eye. Legibility is still paramount however, which is why I chose to use a contrast ratio of xx:xx (recommended for maximum legibility) for the various areas body/article copy.</p>
<p>The footer was designed to gently seal off the layout, thus I only slightly varied its background tone, to that of the main content area. I have tried to keep the footer as useful however, offering a navigational aid to auto scroll users back to the top of the page.</p>

<p>This logo was nothing but a passion job for me. At the time I wanted something with which to brand my newly conceived WordPress folio mash-up, so I began searching for inspiration that suited the dynamic, ever changing nature that is potentially, a WordPress powered website. </p>
<p>Aural lights have always interested me as a visual person, the science behind them, the many variations that they come in and the amazing colour combinations they spawn momentarily all throughout the dawn skyline. This long-standing curiosity of aurorae, also seemed like a nice fit for what I was trying to achieve in my new identity online. Thus, coined from auroras themselves, the name &#8220;glo&#8221; was born (i then added the &#8216;motion + ux&#8217; words in an attempt to offer atleast a tiny bit of affordance to the name &#8230; :P).

<h4>. . .</h4>
<p>To my amazement, several versions of  the &#8216;glo&#8217; domain were available straight up (an occurrence thats increasingly rare nowadays), so without delay, I promptly reg&#8217;d myself a cheap glo domain, and this became the central focus behind my new brand, and the website it was designed for.</p>
<p>Designed to aesthetically encapsulate the beauty of auroras, the glo &#8216;g&#8217; is formed from flowing shapes made of natural blues and greens, in an attempt to capture the appearance of luminescence and movement.

<p>Since it&#8217;s birth, Creative Nature has maintained it&#8217;s own proprietary ASP.Net CMS. During the CMS&#8217;s life time it has had several interface redesigns. I project managed the final of these UI redesigns / re-brands (which should be coming to completion very shortly). After creating a simple, memorable name and brand for the CMS’s UI to follow, I began work pulling together all the feedback I had received from frustrated clients over the years, to formulate a clear strategy that would effectively approach all raised concerns and UI problems – and improve the overall UX performance of the CMS.</p>
<p>Amongst the concerns that I was trying to address, were issues related to inter browser operability, the speed and usability of the CMS and the overall dark and gloomy aesthetic. This redesign attempted to address all of these significant concerns.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col mid-lft">
<div class="d-insde-col">
<h4>. . .</h4>
<p>Along with the overhaul of visuals to a cleaner / more functional interface, a lot of work was done on condensing, streamlining and optimising CMS code and function, which yielded significant performance improvements. I worked very closely with the development team to achieve this outcome and to ensure that the quality of the CMS&#8217;s UX was not sacrificed for ease of development, or any other reason.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;m unable to show off the final CMS with the new UI in action, at this point (as it is a proprietary CMS), but I have a copy of the hollow skins (complete with some jQuery UX enchancement), uploaded <a href="http://stage.glo.id.au/greencms/" target="_blank">here</a> (note you can click the menu items to the left to access different functionality screens &#8211; albiet without the actualy functionality actually plugged in..)</p>

<p>I designed this logo  for a friend, in my spare time.</p>
<p>After it was agreed  that we create a Booze hound character to represent the Boozle brand,  I set to work sketching it out on paper, then moved over to  Illustrator to vectorise the drawings and add the custom typeface,  then finished off by transferring over to Photoshop for final FX.</p>
<p>This brand is about to  be applied to the website online, as part of a complete re-brand –  coming to my folio very soon!</p>
